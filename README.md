# Database from scratch

I itch to know how dbs work. Hereby I decided to make a small database;
big knowledge increase.

## Goals

Here's a list of the feature I plan to implement:

- Background deamon that saves data to file
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations
- Web UI
- API to hook and user the features

Features may be dropped if I deem them a pain that adds no value to me.

## Tools

I'll use Golang 'cause I enjoy it. I'll try to only use high level documentations,
as to not hinder my ~pain~ learning process.

I will sprinkle in some tailwind because I do not enjoy css, nor I enjoy naming classes.
